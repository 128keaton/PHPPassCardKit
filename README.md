PHPPassCardKit is an easy-to-compile application which will add a Pass to your Passbook Wallet. The webserver backend is written in PHP and is based off of https://github.com/tschoffelen/PHP-PKPass. It will generate a Pass which is modified by the username you supply. You can edit it to add more things and a verification backend, such as Starbucks. I will soon be bundling my custom version of https://github.com/tschoffelen/PHP-PKPass with https://github.com/mattt/passbook_rails_example and releasing it as their work. I will take no credit for that
